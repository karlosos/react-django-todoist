## What is this and who is it for 🤷‍♀️

This was my first project in React that I've built in my spare time. React app is based on [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3j87FMR6M). Backend was created by me without any help or tutorial. Github Actions (CI) were also done by me alone. 

> ⚠️ Do not analyse React code as it was not written by me. This was one of the first tutorial projects I did for learning React. I made it public only for archiving reasons and because there are some additional things built over the tutorial base.

I've learnt a lot from this project. Some concepts that I've grasped:
- React with hooks (tutorial scope)
- Javascript fundamentals (tutorial scope)
- Firebase (tutorial scope)
- Javascript unit testing with jest (tutorial scope)
- Django Rest Framework ✅
- Unit testing Django ✅
- Swagger documentation ✅
- Github Actions (CI) ✅

## Features

- Adding and removing tasks
- Tasks categories (projects)
- Dark mode
- Backend REST API endpoints (`/api/v1/`)
- Documentation of endpoints in swagger (`/documentation/`)

## Setting up development environment 🛠
